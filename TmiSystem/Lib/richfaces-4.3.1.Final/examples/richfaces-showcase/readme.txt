========================================================================

RichFaces showcase is an application created to show RichFaces components
in action. It contains a set of small use-cases implemented using RichFaces
components.

This showcase is also mobile compatible with WebKit based browsers; this
includes iOS, Android, and Others. After you deploy the showcase, just
browse to the default context path (for example, http://localhost:8080/showcase)
with a mobile iOS or Android based device. You will see the showcase has
been modified to fit and dynamically adjust to mobile screen widths and
orientations.
We removed some components from the RichFaces Mobile Showcase which
were not mobile ready. For example, rich:tooltip, rich:extendedDataTable,
rich:jquery, and rich:popupPanel either did not make sense in a mobile
environment or needed a heavy rewrite for touch interfaces.
rich:dragDrop however, does work on iOSï¿½ Mobile Safari, but not on Android.
To use rich:dragDrop in Mobile Safari browsers, you can include this snippet
of JavaScript
(https://github.com/richfaces/components/blob/develop/mobile-compatibility/rf-dnd.js)
at the bottom of your JSF template.


The examples shown in the application were chosen from the most popular
questions at the user forum. You will find a lot of useful information on 
how to implement RichFaces components and re-use the code to implement the 
components in your own application.

This file explains how to build and execute the showcase application on
your own server.


BUILDING AND RUNNING THE APPLICATION
------------------------------------

    1. Requirements
    
    In order to build the Showcase application you will need:

        - Maven 3.0.3 or later
        - Servers: Apache Tomcat 6.0 or any JEE6 application server 
       	  (e.g. JBoss AS 7)
        - JDK 1.6

    Also optional Additional Software would make it easy for you to work 
    with the sources of the application:
    	
	- Eclipse IDE + JBoss Tools (to explore and run the application 
	  in IDE). You're obviously free to use any other IDE you wish, but
	  JBoss Tools is recommended. 

    2. Build/Deploy

       - Deploying on Tomcat

       	 To build the project for Tomcat you need to navigate to the 
      	 /examples/richfaces-showcase and run:
	 
		mvn clean package
	
	 When you see the BUILD SUCCESSFUL message you can deploy the 
	 application on the server. To deploy it on Tomcat, copy the .war 
	 file from 'target' folder to TOMCAT_HOME/webapps folder. Then, 
	 launch the startup.sh or startup.bat script from TOMCAT_HOME/bin/ 
	 directory to start the server.

       - Deploying on JEE6 server (JBoss AS 6)

	 To build the project for a JEE6 server you need to navigate to the 
	 /examples/richfaces-showcase and run

	 	mvn clean package -Pjee6

	 When you see the BUILD SUCCESSFUL message you can deploy the 
	 application on the server. To deploy it on the application server 
	 copy the .war file from 'target' folder to the JBOSS_HOME/server/default/deploy 
	 folder (or change "default/" to used profile folder). Then, launch 
	 the run.sh or run.bat script from JBOSS_HOME/bin/ directory to start 
	 the server.

       - Deploying on JBoss AS 7

	 To build the project for a JEE6 server you need to navigate to the
	 /examples/richfaces-showcase and run

		for JBoss AS 7.0.x:
	 	mvn clean package -Pjbas7
	
		or for JBoss AS 7.1.x
		mvn clean package -Pjbas71

	 When you see the BUILD SUCCESSFUL message you can deploy the
	 application on the server.

	 First, make sure the application server is running.  To start the server:

	    launch the standalone.sh or standalone.bat script from JBOSS_HOME/bin/

	    together with parameter --server-config=standalone-full.xml for both 
	    latest JBoss AS 7.1.x and for latest JBoss AS 7.0.x.

	 As of JBoss AS 7.1 you must create the JMS user account/password to
	 enable the JMS push sample.  Add a new user to the ApplicationRealm with the
	 $JBOSS_HOME/bin/add-user.bat or add-user.sh script, with the:
	    username: guest
	    password: password
	        role: guest

	 To deploy it on the application server, use either:

	 1) Use the jboss-as-maven-plugin to deploy to a running application server:

	    mvn jboss-as:deploy -Pjbas7

	 2) Copy the .war file from 'target' folder to the folder:

	    JBOSS_HOME/standalone/deployments

After deploying the examples to your server open a browser and type 
http://localhost:8080/richfaces-showcase to view the examples.

       - Publishing to Google Application Engine (GAE)
       	 
	 We have completed a resource plugin which generates static resources 
	 allowing us to create Google App Engine compatible applications 
	 using RichFaces.  This means deploying to and working with GAE is 
	 a piece of cake.  Here is how you can deploy your own RichFaces showcase 
	 example:

	     * Update the GAE application name, and register it with google.  
	       Do this by updating the /webapp-gae/WEB-INF/appengine-web.xml 
	       following the GAE standard documentation.

	     * if using MyFaces: Configure the MyFaces encryption secret values 
	       in the /webapp-gae/WEB-INF/web.xml. Replace the "-- Insert some secret here --" 
	       with a base64 encoded password. This is important because 
	       otherwise MyFaces will generate random keys, and this causes 
	       issues in a cluster environment like GAE.
		  
	       For more information on JSF encryption check:
	           MyFaces - http://wiki.apache.org/myfaces/Secure_Your_Applicatio
		   Mojarra - http://wikis.sun.com/display/GlassFish/JavaServerFacesRI#JavaServerFacesRI-HowcanIsecureviewstatewhenusingclientsidestatesaving%3F
		  
	     * Build using: mvn clean package -Pgae

             * Use GAE SDK and the appcfg script just as you would for any other 
	       GAE application.

        There are some additional changes that were made in order to make 
	richfaces-showcase GAE compatible:
	     
	     * WebConfiguration class from com.sun.faces were patched removing 
	       code which is not compatible with GAE

	     * web.xml with additional properties for GAE created and placed 
	       at src\main\webapp-gae\WEB-INF\ (it replaces common one during 
	       build with GAE profile)

	     * check pom.xml GAE profile section in order to check additional 
	       dependencies for that configuration


SETTING UP ECLIPSE TO WORK WITH THE SHOWCASE
--------------------------------------------

In order to explore, run and deploy the Showcase using Eclipse IDE you can use 
one of the following options:

    - You could use JBoss Tools with m2eclipse plugin and just import 
      the examples as maven-based projects.
      	  * Open Eclipse and go to File > Import
	  * Expand the project type named Maven and select Import Maven 
	    Project
	  * Browse the directory in which you placed the examples, select 
	    it and press OK.
	  * Press next on the import wizard to finish importing the 
	    examples.

    - Or if you are not using m2eclipse execute use Maven to convert the 
      project to an Eclipse project:
      	 * Open a terminal inside the RichFaces examples directory
	 * execute mvn eclipse:ecllipse
	 * Open Eclipse and select File > Import
	 * Select Import as existing project into workspace after build 
	   is complete.
	 * Follow the instructions on the import wizard.

You are now able to work with the Showcase within Eclipse.
