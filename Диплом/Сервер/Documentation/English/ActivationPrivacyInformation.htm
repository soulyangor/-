		<h1>Privacy Information and Activation Policy</h1>
		<p>Many thanks for using and licensing TEC-IT products! </p>
		<p>This page provides you with information regarding TEC-IT's privacy policy and stored activation data.</p>
		<p><a href="#Activation">Online Activation</a> | <a href="#Manual">Manual Activation (no Internet)</a></p>
		<br/><br/>
		
		<h1>Online Activation<a name="Activation"></a></h1>
		<h2>What is Online Activation?</h2>
    <p>Activating a software product from TEC-IT means that the software connects via Internet to TEC-IT's activation server, sends the data listed below to this activation server and receives a license key from the activation server. This license key is then used to unlock the product permanently.<br/>
       The sole purpose of the activation server is to distribute licenses to customers and to keep track regarding the number of activations for a specific activation key. Thus the activation server is usually only required once. After the product was licensed no Internet connectivity is required. </p>
		<h2>Which Information is sent to TEC-IT?</h2>
    <p>When activating a software product the following information is sent to TEC-IT and maybe stored permanently:</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>
				<b>Activation Key</b><br/>
				This activation key was sent to you by TEC-IT or a reseller of TEC-IT. No personal (or any other encrypted) information is contained within this activation key. 
			</li>
		  <li>
				<b>Company Name, Country, ZIP and City</b><br/>
				This data is required to assign you the purchased license. 
			</li>
		  <li>
				<b>Email Address</b><br/>
				The email address is used to send you a copy of your license key. TEC-IT treats your email address confidential (see below).
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Product IDs</b><br/>
				This product IDs are used to identify the product which you are activating. 
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>System ID</b><br/>
				The System ID identifies the computer on which the product is activated. TEC-IT uses either the volume serial number, the computer's serial number, or the computer's host-name (the name of the computer within your network) to identify a system.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Product Names</b><br/>
				Localized descriptions of the product and the available license variants.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>IP Address, Date and Time</b><br/>
				The IP address of your computer (or Internet gateway) as well as the current date and time are stored for logging purposes.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Does TEC-IT Disclose Information?</h2>
    <p>In general information  like company name, city, zip, state, email, ... is treated strictly confidential and only disclosed to third party in the following circumstances:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>If TEC-IT is required to do so by law</b>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>For the purpose of order processing</b><br/>
        E.g. forwarding required data to payment providers.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>If you agree to disclose your personal information.</b><br/>
        Please note: we will ask you beforehand (e.g. if you would like to serve as a reference customer)!
			</li>
		</ul>
    <p></p>
